This project contains the scripts used to download and process SubX's project data of outgoing longwave radiation (Pegion, K., and Coauthors, 2019: The Subseasonal Experiment (SubX): A Multimodel Subseasonal Prediction Experiment.Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc., 100, 2043â€“2060).

Preliminar results are shown in Alvarez M. & Vera C. 2020: Evaluation of a SubX Multimodel Ensemble to predict an intraseasonal index for South America based on Outgoing Long Wave Radiation, presented at the 45th NOAA Climate Diagnostics and Prediction Workshop

In order to work with the SubX data:

1. Download SubX model data from IRIDL using the "getSUBXIRIXYLMSP.R" (or subdomain version -highly encouraged-) -> netcdf files
2. Download SubX model climatology from IRIDL using "getSUBXIRIXYLMSP_clim_subdomain.R" -> netcdf files
3. Compute anomalies using "compute_rlut_anomalies.R" -> netcdf files
4. Compute ensemble mean using "compute_rlut_ensmean.R" and "compute_rlut_ensmean_NRL.R" -> netcdf files
5. Open ensemble mean from netcdf files and save to single .rdf file to work with R with "opens_ensemblemean_MODEL.R" -> rdf file
6. Compute MME following SubX suggested methodology using "compute_rlut_MME.R" -> .rdf file
